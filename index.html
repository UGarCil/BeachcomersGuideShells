						<p>
							Welcome! This is a guide to identifying the most common shells that can be found on the
							beaches of
							Keats
							Island, British Columbia. This guide will walk you through how to identify these
							species. Keep in mind that while the vast majority of seashells on Keats Island will be one
							of the
							species covered in this guide, there is always the chance of finding something rare! If you
							aren't
							sure
							what something is, post the photo to iNaturalist and experts can help you identify it.

					Before we get into the species, here are some tips when getting started. If you're already familiar
					with shells, feel free to skip to the species entries below!
					There are three main types of animal that leave shells on Keats Island:
					barnacles, snails, and bivalves. Bivalves include clams, oysters, and similar animals, and their
					shells have
					two halves. The spot where the two halves are attached is the hinge, and the details of the bumps on
					the
					inside of the shell near the hinge are often very important for identification.

				</p>
				<hr>

			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<hr>
				<p>
					The two halves of
					the shell are often different at the hinge, so this is important to keep in mind when comparing
					shells.
					When taking photos of a shell for identification, aim to take a closeup of the hinge. Also take a
					photo
					showing the inside of the shell, the outside of the shell, and a side view showing the sillhouette
					(showing how flat or curved the shell is).
					There are nine common bivalves (shellfish) that leave their shells on Keats Island beaches, and six
					common sea snails.

							Barnacles are not related to the other seashells in this guide, but I couldn't include a
							guide to Keats seashells without mentioning them. While the rest of the species in this
							guide are mollusks (related to snails, slugs, octopi, etc), barnacles are actually
							crustaceans, more closely related to crabs than they are to mussels and clams. The most
							ubiquitous barnacle on Keats Island is the Pacific Acorn Barnacle, which forms a ring on the
							rocky bluffs just above the blue mussels. This contributes to the stripey look of our coast
							from a distance: first bare grey rock above the high tide line, then a white ring of
							barnacles at the high tide line, followed by the deep blue ring of mussels below. These
							small white shells will be familiar to any beachgoer who frequents the rocky shores, and can
							be painful to bare-footed beachgoers!

									Blue mussels are the most ubiquitous seashell on Keats Island. They attach

									from a distance.

									Their blue colour and elongated shape make them easy to differentiate from other

									The Pacific Oyster is a common sight on Keats Island's rocky beaches. They live
									their lives with one side of their shell tightly plastered against the rock they are
									growing on, and so they can grow into rather unusual shapes. The edges and top of
									the shell are wavy, and grow in flaky layers. The inside of the shell is pearly
									white. Their unusual shape makes them distinctive from our other Keats Island
									seashells. While it has not been recorded on Keats Island before, local beachcombers
									should keep an eye out for any possible Olympia Oysters, a much less common native
									species. Olympia Oysters are much smaller than Pacific Oysters - only up to 9 cm -
									but identification is tricky. You can learn more <a

									Arguably one of the most distinctive shells on the Keats Island shoreline is
									Nutall's Cockle. These cockle shells can grow very large - about the size of an
									adult's fist - but you can also find tiny ones. They sometimes form distinct growth
									rings across their shells, allowing you to estimate the age of the animal by
									counting the rings like a tree. Cockles tend to live in deeper water, so most of the
									ones we find on the beach will be empty shells except at the lowest tide. When we
									see them out of water, they may look like static shells, but when the live animal is
									under the water and unstressed, it peers out at the world with eyes on tentacle
									stocks, and has the ability to jump away from danger with a strong muscular "foot".

									Take a look at the range of shapes and colours on these Japanese Littleneck Clams
									from Plumper's Cove. The freshest ones have purple interiors, but the older ones
									have faded to white.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are two species of littleneck clams on Keats Island: the Pacific Littleneck
									Clam (native to the region) and the Japanese Littleneck Clam (an introduced
									species). Both species live buried under the sediment in the intertidal zone, so
									live animals are uncommon to see, but their empty shells are abundant on our
									beaches. They are medium size shells that are usually white to grey, and may have
									mottled markings. They have ridges that run down their shell like a cockle, but
									these ridges are not nearly as deep and distinct as Nutall's Cockle.

									Japanese and Pacific Littleneck Clam are vey similar, but can be distinguished by
									three subtle features:

								<ul>
									<li>1) Pacific Littleneck Clam tends to be more rounded, while Japanese Littleneck
										Clam
										tends to have a bit of an indent beside the shell's hinge that makes it look
										more
										asymmetrical. This takes a bit of practice to notice and is best appreciated by
										seeing the two species side-by-side.</li>
									<li>2) Pacific Littleneck Clam has bumpy "teeth" along the inside of the rim of the
										shell. These are very small, but can be felt by running your finger along the
										edge
										if the shell. Japanese Littleneck has a smooth edge without these bumps. Keep in
										mind that old, worn-out shells of the Pacific Littleneck can sometimes have the
										teeth worn away.</li>
									<li>3) Japanese Littleneck Clams usually have a purple shine on the inside of their
										shell, which Pacific Littleneck lacks.</li>
								</ul>

									This distinctive species is abundant on our beaches. Originally from the other side

									The Soft-shelled Clam is named for its thin, weak shell. They can be found on our
									beaches wherever there is a muddy seafloor for them to burrow into. They can grow
									large, but their shells are not particularly strong - they rely on hiding in the mud
									to protect themselves. Their shells are whitish, narrow, and elongated. One end is
									able to close, but the other has a gap where the animal sticks out. They can be
									distinguished from our other common clams by their long shape, weak shells, and
									asymmetrical sides. A surefire way to recognize them is by inspecting the hinge on
									the inside of the shell. One shell has a tall flat flange sticking up, and the other
									shell has a flat area where this flange can interlock to keep the two halves of the
									shell together. This structure is unique - compare the photos of the hinge to the
									otherspecies in ths guide.

									Fat Gaper and Butter Clam are our two species of large clams with strong shells.
									They can grown much larger than littleneck clams! At first glance, the Fat Gaper and
									Butter Clam can be tricky to tell apart, but one key is to look at the hinge on the
									inside of the shell. The Fat Gaper has a deep hollowed-out circular indent where the
									muscles of the live animal would have attached. The Butter Clam doesn't have this
									circle - instead it has tooth-like points in the hinge that stick up, allowing the
									two sides of the shell to lock together. These clams normally live their lives
									buried deep in the mud, with only the tips of their muscular siphons sticking out to
									filter food out of the water.

									Here are some Butter Clams - they don't have the circular indent on the inside of
									their hinges

						Compare the above Butter Clams to the photos of Fat Gapers below. Note the circular indent on

							The last clam on our list is the Pointed Macoma, a medium-sized clam (up to 55.5 cm). It is
							thinner and more pointed than the littleneck clams, and often has peeling remnants of an
							olive-brown layer on the surface of the shell. The shells have ridges that only run parallel
							to the edge of the shell, further distinguishing them from the two littleneck clams that
							have ridges running in two different directions that crisscross (radial ribs and commarginal
							ribs). Butter Clams can look similar when they are small, but the shapes are different:
							Pointed Macomas are pointed on one side, like their name suggests, while Butter Clams are
							rounded. The shape is also different around the hinge: the Macomas point straight back,
							while Butter Clams are slightly crooked. A closeup look at the teeth on the hinge can also
							quickly differentiate them (compare the closeup photos). Soft-shelled Clam can also look
							rather similar at first glance, but has a very different inside of the hinge (compare
							photos).

							Lookalikes to watch for: they are several other Macoma species in the region, though I have
							personally only found Pointed Macoma on Keats Island. One to watch for is Bent-nosed Clam (a
							type of Macoma). Differentiating Macomas requires a careful examination of the shell details
							(and a dive into shell terminology). In Bent-nosed Clam, the pallial line on the left valve
							partially overlaps with the anterior adductor scar <a
								href="https://oimb.uoregon.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/M_nasuta_2019.pdf"
								class="customlink">(source
								with more info)</a>
							Another to watch for is Baltic Macoma, which is pink, not pointed, and does not get as big.

							These tiny sea snails are very abundant on the rocky beach of Keats Island, where they often
							cover the rocks. There are much smaller than dogwingles. There are at least two species of
							Periwinkles on Keats Island: the Checkered Periwinkle and the Sitka Periwinkle. The two are
							similar, but Sitka is stouter, and is ringed by bumpy ridges around its shell.

							There are three common species of limpet om Keats Island: the Shield Limpet, Mask Limpet,
							and Plate Limpet. All three can be found grazing on the rocks and cliffs on the Keats Island
							beaches. When underwater, the limpet slowly crawls over the rocks, scraping algae with its
							tongue-like radula. When the tide goes out, they cling tightly to the rock or shell that
							they find themselves on, waiting for the water to return.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Mask Limpet (Lottia persona) is a large species with an inflated look, caused by the
							sides being convex (bulging outwards). The highest point of the shell is off-centre, towards
							the end where the animal's head would stick out (image to the right). This species is taller
							than the Plate
							Limpet: Mask Limpets are more than 1/3 as tall as they are long, while Plate Limpets are
							less than 1/3 as tall as they are long. Like Plate Limpets, the inside of empty shells have
							a dark spot in the middle, and a checkered pattern around the edges.

						<p>The Plate limpet (Lottia scutum) is a short, flatenned species. The highest point of the
							shell is just slightly off-centre towards the end where the animal's head would stick out.
							It tends to be oval, being longer than it is wide. Like Mask Limpets, the inside of empty
							shells have a dark spot in the middle, and a checkered pattern around the edges.

							The Shield Limpet (Lottia pelta) is similar to the Plate Limpet, but not as flat. It comes
							in a wide range of colours and patterns.</p>
